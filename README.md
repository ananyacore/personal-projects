# Enhanced Substitution Cipher Using C
Designed an improved program for encrypting text using a substitution cipher. The program validates a 26-character user-provided key, ensuring it contains only unique, alphabetic characters. After validation, it encrypts user-provided plaintext while maintaining case sensitivity and ignoring non-alphabetic characters.
